# Linux Process manager
The process manager project written in Rust is a useful tool for managing and monitoring the processes running on a system. 
This project has several features, including the ability to display important process information such as PID, process name, UID, username, CPU usage, disk I/O, and memory usage.
Additionally, the process manager includes customizable columns of information, allowing users to remove any column that is not relevant to their needs. 
It also supports killing a process, which can be handy in situations where a process is misbehaving or causing issues. 
Sorting processes based on specific attributes can help users identify which processes are consuming the most resources, and the search functionality makes it easier to locate specific processes. 
Finally, the filter feature allows users to view either all running processes or sleeping ones based on their state. 
Overall, this project is a valuable tool for anyone needing to manage and monitor processes on their system.
